# 🚧 Changelog

## 2.0.0

Miniflare 2 has been completely redesigned from version 1 with 3 primary design
goals:

1. 📚 **Modular:** Miniflare 2 splits Workers components (KV, Durable Objects,
   etc.) into **separate packages** (`@miniflare/kv`,
   `@miniflare/durable-objects`, etc.) that you can import separately for
   testing.
2. ✨ **Lightweight:** Miniflare 1 included
   [122 third-party packages](http://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/miniflare) with a
   total install size of `88.3MB`. Miniflare 2 reduces this to **24 packages and
   `6MB`** by leveraging features included with Node.js 16.
3. ✅ **Accurate:** Miniflare 2 more accurately replicates the quirks and thrown
   errors of the real Workers runtime, so you'll know before you deploy if
   things are going to break.

Check out the [migration guide](https://v2.miniflare.dev/get-started/migrating)
if you're upgrading from version 1.

### Notable Changes

- ✳️ Node.js 16.7.0 is now the minimum required version
- 🤹 Added a custom Jest test environment, allowing you to run unit tests in the
  Miniflare sandbox, with isolated storage for each test
- 🔌 Added support for running multiple workers in the same Miniflare instance
- ⚡️ Added a live reload feature (`--live-reload`) that automatically refreshes
  your browser when your worker reloads
- 🚪 Added Durable Object input and output gates, and write coalescing
- 🛑 Added the `DurableObjectState#blockConcurrencyWhile(callback)` method
- 📅 Added support for compatibility dates and flags:
  `durable_object_fetch_requires_full_url`, `fetch_refuses_unknown_protocols`,
  `formdata_parser_supports_files`
- 📚 Added a proper CommonJS module loader
- 🗺 Automatically fetch the incoming `Request#cf` object from a trusted
  Cloudflare endpoint
- 🎲 Added support for `crypto.randomUUID()`
- 🔐 Added support for the `NODE-ED25519` algorithm
- ✉️ Added support for sending/receiving binary WebSocket messages

### Breaking Changes

- **Node.js 16.7.0 is now the minimum required version.** You should use the
  latest Node.js version if possible, as Cloudflare Workers use a very
  up-to-date version of V8. Consider using a Node.js version manager such as
  <https://volta.sh/> or <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm>.
- Changed the storage format for Durable Objects and cached responses. If you're
  using file-system or Redis storage, you'll need to delete these
  directories/namespaces.
- Changed the Durable Object ID format to include a hash of the object name.
  Durable Object IDs generated in Miniflare 1 cannot be used with Miniflare 2.
- Correctly implement the Durable Object `script_name` option. In Miniflare 1,
  this incorrectly expected a script path instead of a script name. This now
  relies on mounting the other worker. See
  [📌 Durable Objects](https://v2.miniflare.dev/storage/durable-objects#using-a-class-exported-by-another-script)
  for more details.
- Removed the non-standard `DurableObjectStub#storage()` method. To access
  Durable Object storage outside a worker, use the new
  `Miniflare#getDurableObjectStorage(id)` method, passing a `DurableObjectId`
  obtained from a stub. See
  [📌 Durable Objects](https://v2.miniflare.dev/storage/durable-objects#manipulating-outside-workers)
  for more details.
- Renamed the `--disable-cache`/`disableCache: true` option to
  `--no-cache`/`cache: false`
- Renamed the `--disable-updater` option to `--no-update-check`
- When using the API, `wrangler.toml`, `package.json` and `.env` are no longer
  automatically loaded from their default locations. To re-enable this
  behaviour, set these options to `true`:

  ```js
  const mf = new Miniflare({
    wranglerConfigPath: true,
    packagePath: true,
    envPath: true,
  });
  ```

- Replaced the `ConsoleLog` class with the `Log` class from `@miniflare/shared`.
  You can construct this with a `LogLevel` to control how much information is
  logged to the console:

  ```js
  import { Miniflare, Log, LogLevel } from "miniflare";

  const mf = new Miniflare({
    log: new Log(LogLevel.DEBUG),
  });
  ```

- Load WASM bindings from the standard `wasm_modules` `wrangler.toml` key
  instead of `miniflare.wasm_bindings`.

  ```toml
  ---
  filename: wrangler.toml
  ---
  [miniflare]
  wasm_bindings = [
    { name = "MODULE1", path="module1.wasm" },
    { name = "MODULE2", path="module2.wasm" }
  ]
  ```

  ...should now be...

  ```toml
  ---
  filename: wrangler.toml
  ---
  [wasm_modules]
  MODULE1 = "module1.wasm"
  MODULE2 = "module2.wasm"
  ```

- Renamed the `buildWatchPath` option to `buildWatchPaths`. This is now an array
  of string paths to watch as opposed to a single string.
- Replaced the `Miniflare#reloadOptions()` method with the `Miniflare#reload()`
  and `Miniflare#setOptions({ ... })` methods. `reload()` will reload options
  from `wrangler.toml` (useful if not watching), and `setOptions()` accepts the
  same options object as the `new Miniflare` constructor, applies those options,
  then reloads the worker.
- Replaced the `Miniflare#getCache()` method the `Miniflare#getCaches()` method.
  This returns the global `caches` object. See
  [✨ Cache ](https://v2.miniflare.dev/storage/cache#manipulating-outside-workers).
- `Miniflare#createServer()` now always returns a `Promise` which you must await
  to get a `http.Server`/`https.Server` instance. You may want to check out the
  new `Miniflare#startServer()` method which automatically starts a server using
  the configured `host` and `port`.
- Redis support is no longer included by default. If you're persisting KV,
  Durable Objects or cached responses in Redis, you must install the
  `@miniflare/storage-redis` optional peer dependency.
- Replaced how Miniflare sanitises file paths for file-system storage so
  namespace separators (`/`, `\`, `:` and `|`) now create new directories.
- The result of `Miniflare#dispatchScheduled` will no longer include `undefined`
  if a module scheduled handler doesn't return a value

### Features and Fixes

**Cache:**

- Added support for `cf.cacheKey`, `cf.cacheTtl` and `cf.cacheTtlByStatus` on
  `Request`. Closes
  [issue #37](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/37), thanks
  [@cdloh](https://github.com/cdloh).
- Added the `CF-Cache-Status: HIT` header to matched `Response`s
- Log warning when trying to use cache with `workers_dev = true` in
  `wrangler.toml`. Cache operations are a no-op on `workers.dev` subdomains.
- Throw errors when trying to cache Web Socket, non-`GET`,
  `206 Partial Content`, or `Vary: *` responses
- Throw an error when trying to `open` a cache with a name longer than `1024`
  characters

**CLI:**

- Separated command line options into sections
- Validate types of all command line options

**Core:**

- **Added support for running multiple workers** in the same Miniflare instance.
  See [🔌 Multiple Workers](https://v2.miniflare.dev/core/mount) for more
  details.
- **Added support for compatibility dates and flags**, specifically the flags
  `durable_object_fetch_requires_full_url`, `fetch_refuses_unknown_protocols`,
  **`formdata_parser_supports_files`** are now supported. This feature is
  exposed under the `--compat-date` and `--compat-flag` CLI options, in addition
  to the standard keys in `wrangler.toml`. Closes
  [issue #48](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/48), thanks
  [@PaganMuffin](https://github.com/PaganMuffin). See
  [📅 Compatibility Dates](https://v2.miniflare.dev/core/compatibility) for more
  details.
- **Added a proper CommonJS module loader.** Workers built with Webpack will be
  more likely to work with Miniflare now. Closes
  [issue #44](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/44), thanks
  [@TimTinkers](https://github.com/TimTinkers).
- Incoming request headers are now immutable. Closes
  [issue #36](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/36), thanks
  [@grahamlyons](https://github.com/grahamlyons).
- Disabled dynamic WebAssembly compilation in the Miniflare sandbox
- Fixed `instanceof` on primitives such as `Object`, `Array`, `Promise`, etc.
  from outside the Miniflare sandbox. This makes it much easier to run Rust
  workers in Miniflare, as `wasm-bindgen` frequently generates this code.
- Added a new `--verbose`/`verbose: true` option that enables verbose logging
  with more debugging information
- Throw a more helpful error with suggested fixes when Miniflare can't find your
  worker's script
- Only rebuild parts of the sandbox that need to change when options are updated
- Added a new reload event to `Miniflare` instances that is dispatched whenever
  the worker reloads:

  ```js
  const mf = new Miniflare({ ... });
  mf.addEventListener("reload", (event) => {
    console.log("Worker reloaded!");
  });
  ```

- Added a new `Miniflare#getGlobalScope()` method for getting the global scope
  of the Miniflare sandbox. This allows you to access and manipulate the
  Miniflare environment whilst your worker is running without reloading it.
  Closes [issue #38](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/38), thanks
  [@cdloh](https://github.com/cdloh).
- Added a new `Miniflare#startScheduler()` method that starts a CRON scheduler
  that dispatches `scheduled` events according to CRON expressions in options
- Miniflare-added `CF-*` headers are now included in the HTML error response
- Updated build script to use ES module exports of dependencies where possible.
  Thanks [@lukeed](https://github.com/lukeed) for the
  [PR](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/pull/77).

**Bindings:**

- Added `--global KEY=VALUE`/`globals: { KEY: "value" }` option for binding
  arbitrary values to the global scope. This behaves exactly like the
  `--binding`/`bindings: { ... }` option, but always binds to the global scope,
  even in modules mode.
- Added a new global variable `MINIFLARE` to the Miniflare sandbox, which will
  always have the value `true` when your script is running within Miniflare
- Miniflare now stringifies all environment variables from `wrangler.toml`.
  Closes [issue #50](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/50), thanks
  [@ozburo](https://github.com/ozburo).

**Builds:**

- When running your worker's build script, Miniflare will set the environment
  variable `MINIFLARE=1`. Closes
  [issue #65](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/65), thanks
  [@maraisr](https://github.com/maraisr).
- Added an alias, `-B`, for the `--build-command` option
- Multiple build watch paths can now be specified. If any of them change, your
  worker will rebuild and reload.
- Pass the `--env` flag to `wrangler build` when `--wrangler-env` is set for
  `type = "webpack"`/`"rust"` builds
- Fixed an issue where workers would not rebuild if the build watch path started
  with `./`. Closes
  [issue #53](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/53), thanks
  [@janat08](https://github.com/janat08).

**Standards:**

- **Added support for
  [`crypto.randomUUID()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/randomUUID)**
- **Added support for
  [`structuredClone`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/structuredClone)**
- **Added support for
  [`queueMicrotask`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/queueMicrotask)**
- **Added support for the `NODE-ED25519` algorithm** to `crypto.subtle.sign()`
  and `crypto.subtle.verify()` Note the `transfer` option is only supported on
  Node.js >= 17.
- Throw an error when attempting to create a new `TextDecoder` with a non-UTF-8
  encoding
- Throw errors when attempting to use `FetchEvent`/`ScheduledEvent` methods with
  incorrectly bound `this`
- Throw errors when attempting to call `respondWith()` twice, or after the
  `fetch` handler has finished executing synchronously. Closes
  [issue #63](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/63), thanks
  [@Kikobeats](https://github.com/Kikobeats).
- Added support for the `unhandledrejection` and `rejectionhandled` events
- Throw an error (with a suggested fix) when trying to access an `env` binding
  globally in modules mode
- Throw errors when trying to use `addEventListener()`, `removeEventListener()`
  and `dispatchEvent()` globals in modules mode
- Split the
  `FetchError: No fetch handler responded and unable to proxy request to upstream?`
  error into more specific errors with suggested fixes
- Added the
  [non-standard `Headers#getAll()` method](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/headers#differences).
  This can only be used with the `Set-Cookie` header.
- Switch to a
  [more spec-compliant `fetch` implementation](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/),
  and get `crypto`, `EventTarget` and Web Streams from Node.js. Closes
  [issues #56](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/56) and
  [#59](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/59), thanks
  [@jasnell](https://github.com/jasnell),
  [@jonathannorris](https://github.com/jonathannorris) and
  [@SupremeTechnopriest](https://github.com/SupremeTechnopriest).
- Added support for the
  [`Response#encodeBody` property](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/response#properties).
  If this is omitted or set to `auto`, `Response`s with a `Content-Encoding`
  header that includes `gzip`, `deflate` or `br` will be automatically encoded.
  Closes [issue #72](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/72), thanks
  [@SupremeTechnopriest](https://github.com/SupremeTechnopriest).
- `Request`/`Response` `body`s are now byte streams, allowing them to be read
  with bring-your-own-buffer readers
- Throw an error when attempting to construct a WebSocket response with a status
  other than `101`
- Throw an error when attempting to clone a WebSocket response
- Added support for the non-standard
  `ReadableStreamBYOBReader#readAtLeast(size, buffer)` method
- Include `File` in the Miniflare sandbox. Closes
  [issue #66](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/66), thanks
  [@tranzium](https://github.com/tranzium).

**Durable Objects:**

- **Added input and output gates** for ensuring consistency without explicit
  transactions
- **Added write coalescing** for `put`/`delete` without interleaving `await`s
  for automatic atomic writes
- Added the `DurableObjectState#blockConcurrencyWhile(callback)` method. This
  prevents new `fetch` events being delivered to your object whilst the callback
  runs. Closes [issue #45](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/45),
  thanks [@gmencz](https://github.com/gmencz).
- Added the `DurableObjectId#equals(id)` method for comparing if 2 Durable
  Object IDs have the same hex-ID
- Automatically resolve relative URLs passed to
  `DurableObjectStub#fetch(input, init?)` against `https://fast-host`. Closes
  [issue #27](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/27), thanks
  [@halzy](https://github.com/halzy).
- Throw an error if the string passed to
  `DurableObjectNamespace#idFromString(hexId)` is not 64 hex digits
- Throw an error if the hex-ID passed to
  `DurableObjectNamespace#idFromString(hexId)` is for a different Durable Object
- Throw an error if the ID passed to `DurableObjectNamespace#get(id)` is for a
  different Durable Object
- Throw an error when keys are greater than `2KiB` or `undefined`
- Throw an error when values are greater than `32KiB`
- Throw an error when attempting to `get`, `put` or `delete` more than `128`
  keys, or when attempting to modify more than `128` keys in a transaction
- Throw an error when attempting to `put` an `undefined` value
- Throw an error when attempting to list keys with a negative `limit`
- Throw an error when attempting to perform an operation in a rolledback
  transaction or in a transaction that has already committed
- Throw an error when attempting to call `deleteAll()` in a transaction
- Throw an error when a Durable Object `fetch` handler doesn't return a
  `Response`
- Use the same V8 serialization as Cloudflare Workers to store values
- Fixed an issue where keys added in a transaction callback were not reported as
  deleted in the same transaction
- Fixed an issue where keys added in a transaction callback were not included in
  the list of keys in the same transaction

**HTMLRewriter:**

- Remove `Content-Length` header from `HTMLRewriter` transformed `Response`s
- Don't start transforming until transformed `Response` body is needed
- Throw an error when attempting to transform body streams containing
  non-ArrayBuffer/ArrayBufferView chunks

**HTTP Server:**

- **Added a live reload feature**, that automatically refreshes your browser
  when your worker reloads. For this to work, pass the `--live-reload` option,
  and return an HTML response containing a `<body>` tag with the `Content-Type`
  set to `text/html`. See
  [⚡️ Live Reload](https://v2.miniflare.dev/developing/live-reload) for more
  details.

  ```js
  addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
    const body = `
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <body>
        <p>Try update me!</p>
      </body>
      </html>
    `;

    const res = new Response(body, {
      headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=utf-8" },
    });

    event.respondWith(res);
  });
  ```

- **Automatically fetch the incoming `Request#cf` object** from a trusted
  Cloudflare endpoint, so the values are the same as you'd get for real. Closes
  [issue #61](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/61), thanks
  [@aaronsdevera](https://github.com/aaronsdevera) and
  [@Electroid](https://github.com/Electroid).
- Added a `metaProvider` option that allows you fetch metadata for an incoming
  `Request`:

  ```js
  const mf = new Miniflare({
    async metaProvider(req) {
      return {
        forwardedProto: req.headers["X-Forwarded-Proto"],
        realIp: req.headers["X-Forwarded-For"],
        cf: {
          // Could get these from a geo-IP database
          colo: "SFO",
          country: "US",
          // ...
        },
      };
    },
  });
  ```

- Split out the Node request to `Request` object conversion logic into a
  `convertNodeRequest(req, meta?)` function. You can import this from
  `@miniflare/http-server`.
- Only return a pretty-error page when the request `Accept` header includes
  `text/html`
- Added a new `Miniflare#startServer(options?)` method that starts an HTTP
  server using the configured `port` and `host`. `options` can be a
  `http.ServerOptions` or `https.ServerOptions` object. Closes
  [issue #39](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/39), thanks
  [@amlwwalker](https://github.com/amlwwalker)
- Include a default `Content-Type` header of `text/plain` in `Response`s. Closes
  [issue #57](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/57), thanks
  [@Rysertio](https://github.com/Rysertio).

**Jest Environment:**

- Added a custom Jest test environment, allowing you to run unit tests in the
  Miniflare sandbox, with isolated storage for each test. See
  [🤹 Jest Environment](https://v2.miniflare.dev/testing/jest) for more details.

**KV:**

- Throw an error when keys are empty, `.`, `..`, `undefined`, or greater than
  `512B` when UTF-8 encoded
- Throw an error when values are greater than `25MiB`
- Throw an error when metadata is greater than `1KiB`
- Throw an error when the `cacheTtl` option is less than `60s`
- Throw an error when `expirationTtl` is non-numeric, less than or equal 0, or
  less than `60s`
- Throw an error when `expiration` is non-numeric, less than or equal the
  current time, or less than `60s` in the future
- Throw an error when the `limit` passed to `KVNamespace#list()` is non-numeric,
  less than or equal `0`, or greater than `1000`

**Scheduler:**

- Moved the `/.mf/scheduled` endpoint for triggering scheduled events to
  `/cdn-cgi/mf/scheduled`. Closes
  [issue #42](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/42), thanks
  [@ObsidianMinor](https://github.com/ObsidianMinor).
- Switched the CRON validation and scheduling package from
  [`node-cron`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron) to
  [`cron-schedule`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron-schedule). This improves
  error messages for invalid CRON expressions, and removes a transitive
  dependency on `moment-timezone`, reducing the installation size by 5MB.

**Workers Sites:**

- Added support for the new `__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST` text module allowing you
  to use Workers Sites in modules mode

**Web Sockets:**

- Added support for **sending/receiving binary messages**. Closes
  [issue #67](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/67), thanks
  [@NostalgiaRunner](https://github.com/NostalgiaRunner).
- Removed the `WebSocket#readyState` property. Closes
  [issue #47](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/47), thanks
  [@aboodman](https://github.com/aboodman).
- Wait for worker response before opening WebSocket in client, closes
  [issue #88](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/88), thanks
  [@TimTinkers](https://github.com/TimTinkers).
- `http` and `https` protocols are now required for WebSocket upgrades via
  `fetch` as per the workers runtime
- Throw an error when attempting to use a `WebSocket` in a `Response` that has
  already been used
- Throw an error when attempting to use a `WebSocket` in a `Response` after
  calling `accept()` on it
- Throw an error when attempting to construct a `WebSocket` using the
  `WebSocket` constructor
- Throw an error when attempting to call `WebSocket#send()` or
  `WebSocket#close()` without first calling `accept()`. Closes
  [issue #43](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/43), thanks
  [@aboodman](https://github.com/aboodman).
- Throw an error when attempting to call `WebSocket#send()` after calling
  `close()`
- Throw an error when attempting to call `WebSocket#close()` on an already
  closed WebSocket
- Throw an error when attempting to call `WebSocket#close()` with an invalid
  close code
- Make WebSocket event constructors more spec-compliant

- [📚 Modules](https://v2.miniflare.dev/core/modules) mode is now always enabled
  when specifying
  [📌 Durable Objects](https://v2.miniflare.dev/storage/durable-objects##objects)
  bindings

### Fixes

- Fixed **Windows** support, closes
  [issue #10](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/issues/10)
- Fixed issue where scripts were not reloaded correctly when editing script path
  in `wrangler.toml`. Scripts are now always reloaded on options change.
  `Miniflare.reloadScript()` is now deprecated. You should use
  `Miniflare.reloadOptions()` instead.

## 1.1.0

### Features

- Added support for namespaced caches with `caches.open`. See
  [✨ Cache](https://v2.miniflare.dev/storage/cache) for more details.

## 1.0.1

### Fixes

- Fixed
  `/usr/bin/env: 'node --experimental-vm-modules': No such file or directory`
  error when running the CLI in Linux. See
  [💻 Using the CLI](https://v2.miniflare.dev/get-started/cli#usage) for more
  details.

## 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- The first and only argument to the `Miniflare` constructor is now an object.
  Scripts should be specified via the `script` option for strings and the
  `scriptPath` option for files:

  ```js
  // Previous version
  import vm from "vm";
  import { Miniflare } from "miniflare";

  const mf1 = new Miniflare(
    new vm.Script(`addEventListener("fetch", (event) => { ... })`),
    { kvPersist: true }
  );
  const mf2 = new Miniflare("script.js", { kvPersist: true });
  ```

  ```js
  // New version
  import { Miniflare } from "miniflare";

  const mf1 = new Miniflare({
    script: `addEventListener("fetch", (event) => { ... })`,
    kvPersist: true,
  });
  const mf2 = new Miniflare({
    scriptPath: "script.js",
    kvPersist: true,
  });
  ```

- The `Miniflare.getNamespace` method has been renamed to
  `Miniflare.getKVNamespace`
- Logged errors will now throw a `MiniflareError` if no log is provided
- When using file system KV persistence, key names are now sanitised to replace
  special characters such as `:`, `/`, and `\`. Reading keys containing these
  characters may now return `null` if a value was stored in the previous
  version.

  `crypto.subtle.digest("md5", data)`
- Fixed handling of `ignoreMethod` option for `Cache` `match` and `delete`
- Disabled edge caching when using Workers Sites, files are now always loaded
  from disk
- Provided `Set` and `WeakSet` from Miniflare's realm to sandbox, removing
