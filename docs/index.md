# ðŸ”¥ Miniflare

**Miniflare** is a simulator for developing and testing
[**Cloudflare Workers**](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

- ðŸŽ‰ **Fun:** develop workers easily with detailed logging, file watching and
  pretty error pages supporting source maps.
- ðŸ”‹ **Full-featured:** supports most Workers features, including KV, Durable
  Objects, WebSockets, modules and more.
- âš¡ **Fully-local:** test and develop Workers without an internet connection.
  Reload code on change quickly.

It's written in TypeScript, and runs your
workers in a sandbox implementing Workers' runtime APIs.

These docs primarily cover Miniflare specific things. For more information on
runtime APIs, refer to the
[Cloudflare Workers docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

If you find something that doesn't behave as it does in the real Workers
environment (and this difference isn't documented), or something's wrong in
these docs, please
[open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/new/choose).
